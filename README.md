## Debugging

If you encounter any problems with the simple shell, you can use the `-d` flag to enable debugging mode. This will print additional information to the console, which can help you track down the source of the problem.

## Building

To build the simple shell, you will need to have a C compiler installed. Once you have a compiler, you can build the shell by running the following command:

    gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o shell


## Running

The simple shell can be run using the following command:

    ./shell


## Additional Features

-   Handling of command lines with arguments.
-   Handling of the PATH environment variable.
-   Implementation of the  `exit`  built-in, which exits the shell.
-   Implementation of the  `env`  built-in, which prints the current environment.
